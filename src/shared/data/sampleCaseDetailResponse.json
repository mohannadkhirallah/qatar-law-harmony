      {
        "principle": "Systematic Interpretation & Regulatory Consistency",
        "description": "MOCI regulatory guidelines (Circular 5/2015) and QFC regulations both reference Law 7/2014 as the primary LLC framework. Applying Law 9/2002 would create regulatory fragmentation and contradict established administrative practice across 8+ years of implementation."

    ],
    "explanatoryNote": "The contradiction between Law 7/2014 Article 215 and Law 9/2002 Article 89 creates legal uncertainty for limited liability company formation in Qatar. Analysis of legislative chronology, regulatory practice, and policy objectives supports the application of Law 7/2014 as the controlling statute.\n\nKey rationale:\n\n1. **Temporal Precedence**: Law 7/2014 post-dates Law 9/2002 by 12 years, establishing lex posterior priority.\n\n2. **Explicit Modernization Intent**: The 2014 law was enacted specifically to modernize Qatar's commercial framework in preparation for economic diversification. Parliamentary debates (Shura Council Session 42, May 2014) confirm intentional expansion of LLC eligibility to single members.\n\n3. **International Alignment**: Single-member LLCs are permitted in UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Oman under recent GCC harmonization efforts. Qatar's 2014 law aligns with this regional trend.\n\n4. **Regulatory Practice**: MOCI has accepted and registered 300+ single-member LLCs since 2015 under Law 7/2014, creating legitimate expectations and administrative precedent.\n\n5. **Capital Requirements**: The higher minimum capital (QAR 200,000) in the 2014 law provides superior creditor protection, particularly relevant given Qatar's position as regional financial hub.\n\n**Recommended Resolution**: Law 7/2014 should be applied. To eliminate ambiguity, MOCI should issue an administrative circular explicitly confirming that Law 7/2014 supersedes Law 9/2002 for all LLC formations post-July 2014, and the Shura Council should consider formal amendment to insert express repeal language in Law 7/2014.",
    "implementationSteps": [
      "Issue MOCI Administrative Circular (within 30 days) confirming Law 7/2014 as exclusive framework for LLC formation, explicitly stating that Law 9/2002 Article 89 is superseded.",
      "Update MOCI online registration portal and printed application forms to reference only Law 7/2014 requirements (single-member allowed, QAR 200,000 minimum capital).",
      "Conduct training workshops for MOCI registration officers (2 sessions, 60 participants) on correct application of 2014 law and handling legacy cases.",
      "Notify Qatar Chamber of Commerce, law firms, and business advisory firms via official letter regarding clarified legal position.",
      "Publish FAQ document (Arabic/English) on MOCI website addressing common questions about single-member LLCs and capital requirements.",
      "Propose legislative amendment to Shura Council for next session to insert express repeal clause in Law 7/2014: 'Article [X]: Law No. 9/2002 Articles 89-95 are hereby repealed.'"
    ],
    "alternativeApproach": "If immediate legislative amendment is not feasible, request Supreme Judicial Council to issue an interpretive ruling (fatwa tashri'iyya) clarifying that Law 7/2014 governs LLCs and implicitly repealed conflicting provisions of Law 9/2002. Such rulings carry persuasive authority in Qatari courts and provide interim legal certainty pending formal legislative action."
